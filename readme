# IoT Device Simulator 🚀

Simulates multiple IoT devices using Python + MQTT to mimic real-world behavior. Each device publishes sensor data and listens for command topics.

## 🔧 Features

- Simulates multiple devices using threads
- Publishes JSON-formatted data (temp, humidity)
- Subscribes to command topics (e.g. `device001/commands`)
- Built with Python and paho-mqtt
- Tested with HiveMQ Broker

## 🧠 Architecture

- MQTT Broker: HiveMQ Public Cloud
- Client: Python (paho-mqtt)
- Topics: `deviceID/data` and `deviceID/commands`
